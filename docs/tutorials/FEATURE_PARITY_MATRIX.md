## Architecture Differences

### Hooks vs MCP Servers

**Claude Code:**
- Uses VS Code extension hooks for automatic functionality
- Tight integration with IDE events and UI
- Automatic tool invocation based on context
- Real-time notifications and status updates

**Codex:**
- Uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration

- Codex offers explicit control and better isolation
- MCP enables cross-platform compatibility and custom server development

### Automatic vs Explicit

**Claude Code:**
- Automatic memory loading, quality checks, and transcript saves
- Hooks trigger operations based on IDE events
- Minimal user intervention required
- Real-time feedback and notifications

**Codex:**
- Explicit tool calls for most operations
- Wrapper script provides automation layer
- User has full control over when operations occur
- Enhanced automation through smart features (auto-checks, periodic saves)

**Implications:**
- Claude Code better for interactive development
- Codex better for scripted workflows and automation

### VS Code Integration vs CLI-First

**Claude Code:**
- Built specifically for VS Code
- Leverages VS Code APIs and extension system
- Rich UI integration and notifications
- Automatic file watching and change detection

**Codex:**
- CLI-first design with no IDE dependencies

- Access to MCP tools (task_tracker, web_research)

**Implications:**
- Claude Code better for complex agent workflows
- Codex better for simple, controlled agent execution

## Remaining Gaps

### What 5% is Still Missing

The remaining 5% gap consists of deep VS Code-native features that cannot be replicated in a CLI-first architecture:

1. **Real-time Notifications**: VS Code status bar updates, notifications, and UI indicators
2. **Automatic File Watching**: Real-time quality checks triggered by file changes
3. **Rich Command Completion**: Integrated slash command system with auto-completion
4. **Parallel Agent Execution**: Simultaneous multiple agent execution
5. **Deep IDE Integration**: Access to VS Code's internal APIs and extension ecosystem

### Why These Gaps Exist (Architectural Constraints)

**CLI vs IDE Architecture:**
- Codex operates as a standalone CLI tool with no access to VS Code's internal APIs
- MCP protocol provides tool integration but not UI integration
- VS Code extension architecture enables deep IDE hooks that CLI tools cannot access

**Communication Model:**
- Codex uses stdio-based MCP communication, limiting real-time capabilities
- Claude Code uses VS Code's extension host for direct IDE integration
- No equivalent mechanism exists for CLI tools to provide real-time IDE feedback

**Execution Model:**
- Codex executes agents sequentially via `codex exec`
- Claude Code can spawn parallel agents through VS Code's task system
- CLI environment lacks the parallelism and coordination of an IDE extension host

### Workarounds Available

**For Real-time Notifications:**
- Use terminal notifications (`notify-send` on Linux, `osascript` on macOS)
- Monitor log files for status updates
- Implement custom notification systems via MCP servers

**For Automatic File Watching:**
- Use external file watchers (`fswatch`, `watchexec`)
- Implement periodic checks in wrapper script
- Create custom MCP servers for file monitoring

**For Rich Command Completion:**
- Bash completion scripts for shortcuts
- Custom shell functions with tab completion
- MCP server-based command assistance

**For Parallel Agent Execution:**
- Shell job control and background processes
- Custom orchestration scripts
- Multiple Codex instances (not recommended)

**For Deep IDE Integration:**
- VS Code extensions that call Codex CLI
- Custom IDE plugins wrapping Codex functionality
- Hybrid approach using both backends

### Recommendations

**For VS Code Users:** Use Claude Code for the full integrated experience, reserving Codex for automation and CI/CD tasks.

**For Mixed Environments:** Use Codex as the primary backend with Claude Code for VS Code-specific workflows.

**For Headless Operation:** Codex provides 95% parity with superior automation capabilities.

**For Team Consistency:** Codex enables consistent workflows across different editors and environments.
