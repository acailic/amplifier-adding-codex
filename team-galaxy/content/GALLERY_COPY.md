  introduction: [
    "This exhibition presents something revolutionary: the recognition that software",
    "development is not merely an engineering discipline but an art form, and that",
    "every team of developers creates not just products, but culture.",
    "",
    "Each piece in this gallery represents a unique constellation of human creativity,",
    "transformed from mere metrics into meaningful artifacts. These are your digital",
    "fossils, your team's fingerprints on the universe of technology.",
    "",
    "Like ancient cave paintings that reveal the collaborative spirit of early humans,",
    "these visualizations capture the essence of how modern humans work together to",
    "shape our digital future. They are testaments to the beauty that emerges when",
    "diverse minds align toward common purpose.",

    "Welcome to the museum of your own making."

        "This team exhibits the classic pattern of organic expansion—growth that builds",
        "upon itself while maintaining coherence. Like the spiral arms of our own",

        "",
        "The beauty of irregularity lies in its responsiveness, its willingness to",

        "entirely new approaches to collaboration itself."
